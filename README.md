# MyFirst-PHP-Program
Wrote this in 2000 it was my first PHP application that I wrote to build CMS engine that would handle multiple Sites with one codebase.  Pre me knowing about rewrite rules lol enjoy

What you have to remember is that IE 4 was the best browser on the market at the time.  Hell I don't even know if this works 

The is an installer would set up the site with a self build the database and site structure. 

Like I said this was pre me finding out about rewrite rules. which would have made life so much easier.


IT had the following functionality

1. the ability to create a WAI level 3 compliane site.  
2. The ability to theme the site to a folder level.
3. a management tool that allowed the defintion of page layout with widgets etc. 

about 70 modules allowing a licenced web site to have one of three different types of access 

1. simple web site builder, 
2. a middle level that allowed a workflow for the publishing of web sites
3. an Enterprise level access that enabled versionined as well as the workflow level.
